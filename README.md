## Introduction

This repository includes an implementation for a tool capable of transforming information from different sources into FHIR format. The connector has different working modes, and the desired one must be specified. The following working modes are currently available:
- fhs-git: pulls a git repository containing .fsh files, converts them to JSON format and uploads them to the specified HAPI FHIR server.
- HAPI FHIR sync: pulls resources from a HAPI FHIR server and writes them to the specified FHIR server.
- HAPI FHIR proxy: the connector acts as a proxy for FHIR resources. When a resource is requested to the connector, it will look for the resource in all the FHIR sources it has available.

The following sections in the README document help to install and deploy the connector and understand how the transformation tool has been developed.


## Active deployments in FOSPS - Gravitate Health


### GIT_FSH HL7 EPI resources

- Syncs [HL7 Gravitate Health ePI repository](https://github.com/hl7-eu/gravitate-health). Uploads ePI in [this folder](https://github.com/hl7-eu/gravitate-health/tree/master/input/fsh) as bundles to FHIR server.


### GIT_FSH HL7 IPS resources

- Syncs [HL7 Gravitate Health IPS repository](https://github.com/hl7-eu/gravitate-health-ips). Uploads IPS in [this folder](https://github.com/hl7-eu/gravitate-health-ips/tree/master/input/fsh) as bundles to FHIR server.


## Environment variables

The following environment variables must be set:

| Task          	    | Description                                                 	| Possible values                       	          |

To create API KEY secret:

kubectl create secret generic budibase-smm-api-key-secret --from-literal=apikey=API_KEY_STRING
```
kubectl create secret generic budibase-smm-api-key-secret --from-literal=apikey=363d4adf8234c7ac0a9e9a356addd061-c544898c110bd82ee96436d2b95039fc3d84690af962993bf1f196951653f9d0444ad1e8abaff19d

## Deployment

### Local deployment

First, install requierements:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

And run the application:
```bash
python3 app.py
```

To deploy locally, you can create a `.env` file and change the environment variables.


### Deployment

The deployment of the app can be done in Docker or kubernetes.

#### Docker

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Gravitate-Health/fhir-connector
cd fhir-connector
docker build . -t YOUR_IMAGE_NAME
docker run YOUR_IMAGE_NAME
```

#### Kubernetes (Kustomize)

Production: 
```bash
kubectl apply -k kubernetes/base
```

Development: 
```bash
kubectl apply -k kubernetes/dev
```
